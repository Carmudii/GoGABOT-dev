# GoGABOT
GoGABOT is an experimental Growtopia bot built with C++, making it easy to run on any device like a VPS or phone with TERMUX!
The advantage of GoGABOT is that it does not require additional applications. it only requires a terminal to run it and it doesn't take up much RAM and is very easy to run in low spec environments. 
even though it only requires a terminal, GoGABOT is also equipped with a UI, making it easier for you to make settings on the bot.
